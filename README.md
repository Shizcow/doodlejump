# doodlejump
This is a simple game, made for arduino and a TFT display. 

Tested with: 
- Arduino Mega 2560 
- 2.8" TFT display

Compiled using Arduino.mk. Will also compile with Arduino IDE, so long as the correct libraries are installed.
For a list of libraries, see the Makefile. All these libraries are available through Arduino IDE.

All images in assets/ are not used during runtime or compilation. They have been put into font.h using a site such as [this](https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/image-to-byte-array/)
